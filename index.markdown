# Welcome to ULL CompSci Planner!  
If you're a computer science student at ULL and you're confused about which courses to take when, then you're in the right place.  
  
We conducted a survey to rank the core CMPS classes on a difficulty scale from one to ten, and put the average scores for each course here. Along with a description from interviewing students who have already taken the courses and the course catalog information, you can find information here that should help you make the most out of scheduling every semester.  
  
Use the navigation bar on the left to find out more about each class.  
Here's the core classes of CMPS flowchart for handy reference:
