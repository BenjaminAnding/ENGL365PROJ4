Here are a few helpful tips:

* Read your books! A lot of material that seems hard is explained very well in the required texts.  
  
* You can get a lot of the books online for free if you look hard enough.  
  
* If you're having trouble with a concept: try talking to the TA for the course, or even better make an appointment with the professor during his or her office hours.  
    
* Join the Computer Science Discord server.  Find someone in it and ask them to invite you. These guys and gals have been through a lot of the classes you have to take and are a wealth of knowledge and help.  
  
* Try to knock out [CMPS 341]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}classPages/cmps341) and [CMPS 340]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}classPages/cmps340) as soon as possible as these are prereqs for a lot of electives.  
  
* Save [CMPS 455]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}classPages/cmps455) and [CMPS 310]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}classPages/cmps310) for your last semester if possible!
