# Prereq:  
[CMPS 261]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}classPages/cmps261) and [MATH 270]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}classPages/math270) both with a grade of “C” or better.  
  
# Course Description:  
Formal logic and its applications. Proof of correctness. Sets and combinatorics. Induction, recursion, and recurrence equations. Relations, functions, and graphs: shortest path and minimal spanning tree, planarity, Eulerian paths, Hamiltonian cycles. Algebraic structures, finite-state machines, turing machines, and computational notions.  
  
# Summary:  
Discrete math course.  This is mostly things like logic and set theory.  The course is completely theory, no programming involved.  
  
# Hours:  
3 Credit hours, 3 Lecture hours.  
  
# Difficulty:  6/10  
  
# Take next:
