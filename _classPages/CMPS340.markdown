# Prereq:  
[CMPS 261]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}classPages/cmps261) and [MATH 270]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}classPages/math270) both with a grade of “C” or better.  
  
# Course Description:  
Algorithm analysis and asymptotic notation. Advanced data structures analysis. Design and analysis of: divide-and-conquer algorithms, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, and amortized analysis; multithreaded algorithms, linear programming, number-theoretic algorithms, computational geometry and approximation algorithms.  
  
# Summary:  
Algorithms is a great course if you love puzzles. Some of the concepts can be a bit tough, but it is all very doable. You will do a lot of time complexity and space complexity analysis of pseudo-code, but you don't have to worry about writing anything syntax specific.  
  
# Hours:  
3 Credit hours, 3 Lecture hours.  
  
# Difficulty:  6/10
